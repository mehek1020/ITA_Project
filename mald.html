      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <div class="info">
        <br />
        <p>
          The Maldives' geography significantly shapes its international
          relationships and economic strategies. Being an archipelagic state in
          the Indian Ocean, it consists solely of atolls and coral islands,
          positioning it strategically along key maritime routes. This geographic
          setting enhances its connections with major trading partners such as
          India, Sri Lanka, and other Asian countries, facilitating trade and
          tourism.

              The northernmost atolls of the Maldives, including Haa Alif, Haa
              Dhaalu, and Shaviyani, feature stunning coral islands surrounded by
              clear blue waters. These atolls are known for their rich marine
              life and relatively untouched coral reefs, providing excellent
              opportunities for diving and snorkeling.

              The central region of the Maldives includes atolls like Male, Faafu,
              and Meemu. Male, the capital, serves as the political and economic
              hub of the country. This area also showcases the traditional
              Maldivian way of life alongside modern luxury resorts that are
              popular with tourists seeking relaxation and water sports.

              The southern atolls such as Addu, Gaafu Dhaalu, and Huvadhu are
              noted for their deeper and more abundant coral reefs and are less
              frequented by tourists, offering a more secluded and pristine
              environment. The equatorial location of these atolls results in rich
              biodiversity and vibrant marine ecosystems.

              The entire country of the Maldives, being an island nation, is a
              vast coastal region with over 1,000 coral islands grouped in a
              double chain of 26 atolls, spread over roughly 90,000 square
              kilometers. These islands boast some of the world's most beautiful
              beaches and lagoons with crystal-clear waters, making them a prime
              location for tourism.

              seamlessly. The islands are known for their white sandy beaches,
              palm trees, and the surrounding turquoise waters filled with vibrant
              coral reefs and diverse marine life.

        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            The culture of the Maldives is heavily influenced by the surrounding
            areas of India and Sri Lanka, as well as Arab traders who brought Islam
            to the archipelago in the 12th century. The predominant religion, Islam,
            shapes the cultural ethos and practices of the Maldivian people.
            Traditional music, dance, and crafts also display a synthesis of
            influences that include Indian, Sri Lankan, and Arab elements. The
            Dhivehi language, with its own script, is closely related to languages
            spoken in Sri Lanka and southern India.

          <img class="cul" src="./images/his_mal.jpeg" alt="History Image" />
          <p>
            Historically, the Maldives has been strategically important due to its
          location along major maritime trade routes in the Indian Ocean. The
          islands were influenced by various maritime powers, including the
          Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British, before gaining independence as a
          British protectorate in 1965. The legacy of these interactions is
          evident in the blend of architectural, linguistic, and cultural elements
          found across the islands.

        <h3>Diplomatic Relation</h3>

        <br />

        <p>
          Maldives’ diplomatic relations are primarily focused on maintaining
          strong ties with its neighbors, particularly India and Sri Lanka, due to
          geographical proximity and shared maritime interests. Recently, the
          Maldives has strengthened its diplomatic outreach by engaging more with
          global powers and participating in international forums. The country
          places a high priority on environmental diplomacy, advocating for global
          action on climate change, which poses a significant threat to its
          low-lying islands.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />

        <h3>Regional Cooperation</h3>

        <br />

        <p>
          The Maldives is an active member of the South Asian Association for
          Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which promotes economic and regional
          integration. The country is also involved in the Indian Ocean Rim
          Association (IORA), reflecting its strategic interest in contributing
          to the safety and security of maritime routes in the region. Through
          these platforms, the Maldives seeks to enhance its environmental
          security, trade opportunities, and regional connectivity.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          In recent years, the Maldives has actively pursued initiatives to
          strengthen its foreign relations and economic resilience. The country
          has focused on enhancing its position as a key player in the Indian
          Ocean region through strategic diplomacy and international
          collaborations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <br />

        <p>
          The Maldives’ relationships with its neighbors and other countries are
          deeply intertwined with its geographical identity as a small island
          nation in a strategic location. While the country faces unique
          challenges, particularly related to environmental vulnerability and
          economic dependence on tourism, it continues to leverage its diplomatic
          relations to enhance its stature on both regional and global stages,
          promoting sustainable development and climate resilience initiatives.
