  <h3>Geography</h3>
  <div class="info">
    <br/>
    <p>
      Myanmar's geography plays a pivotal role in shaping its relations with neighboring countries. The country is bordered by the Himalayas to the north, which serve as a natural barrier influencing trade routes, migration patterns, and geopolitical dynamics. To the south, Myanmar's extensive coastline along the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea facilitates maritime trade and connectivity with countries like Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. Myanmar's geography is diverse, featuring rugged highlands in the north, fertile plains in the central region, and tropical coastlines in the south, each influencing its economic activities and cross-border interactions.

        <td>Northern Mountains</td>
        <td>The northern regions of Myanmar are part of the southern Himalayas, with mountain ranges that include Hkakabo Razi, the country's highest peak. This region features rugged terrain, snow-capped peaks in extreme northern areas, and dense forests that are part of the biodiversity-rich Eastern Himalayan region.</td>

    <h3>Culture</h3>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Cultural exchanges between Myanmar and its neighbors are deeply rooted in shared histories, religions, and traditions. Buddhism, for example, spread from India to Myanmar, deeply influencing its culture, traditions, and daily life, thereby fostering strong cultural ties across the region. Additionally, Myanmar shares linguistic and cultural similarities with Thailand due to shared ethnolinguistic groups and historical interactions. The country also exhibits influences from China and India, reflecting a diverse cultural mosaic that underscores its position as a crossroad between South and Southeast Asia.

    <h3>History</h3>

      <img class="cul" src="./images/his_myan.jpeg"/>
      <p>
        Historically, Myanmar's relations with its neighbors have been influenced by colonial legacies, border disputes, and internal conflicts. The region now known as Myanmar fell under British colonial rule as part of the British Raj, alongside India, shaping its modern boundaries and ethnic compositions. This colonial history has contributed to complex relationships with neighboring countries such as China, India, and Thailand. Post-independence, Myanmar has faced numerous internal ethnic conflicts and border disputes that have affected its relations with these countries, especially in managing refugee flows and cross-border insurgencies.
