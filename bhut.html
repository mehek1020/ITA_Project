      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <div class="info">
        <br />
        <p>
          z India's geography plays a pivotal role in shaping its relations with
          neighboring countries. The Himalayas to the north serve as a natural
          barrier, influencing trade routes, migration patterns, and
          geopolitical dynamics. India's extensive coastline along the Indian
          Ocean facilitates maritime trade and connectivity with countries like
          Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Indonesia. India's geography is diverse and
          encompasses a wide range of landscapes, from the towering Himalayas in
          the north to the expansive coastal plains in the south.

              The Himalayan mountain range forms India's northern border,
              containing some of the world's highest peaks, including Mount
              Everest. This region is characterized by snow-capped mountains,
              deep valleys, and glaciers.

              South of the Himalayas lie the fertile Indo-Gangetic plains, one
              of the most densely populated regions in the world. These plains
              are crisscrossed by several major rivers, including the Ganges,
              Yamuna, and Brahmaputra, which support intensive agriculture.

              the Western and Eastern Ghats. These mountain ranges are known for
              their rich biodiversity and tropical forests, with the Western
              Ghats particularly renowned for its UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

              ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and scrublands.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Cultural exchanges between India and its neighbors are deeply
              rooted in shared histories, religions, and traditions. Buddhism,
              for example, spread from India to countries like Nepal, Bhutan,
              Sri Lanka, and Myanmar, fostering cultural ties across the region.
              Similarly, Hinduism has influenced the cultural landscape of
              Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.

          <p>
            Historically, India's relations with its neighbors have been shaped
            by colonial legacies, border disputes, and independence struggles.
            The legacy of British colonialism left a complex legacy,
            particularly in relations between India and Pakistan. The partition
            of British India in 1947 led to the creation of Pakistan, resulting
            in one of the most contentious borders in the world and subsequent
            conflicts, notably over the region of Kashmir.

      <h3>Diplomatic Relation</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Diplomatic relations between India and its neighbors are multifaceted,
          ranging from cooperation in areas such as trade, security, and
          cultural exchange to tensions over territorial disputes and
          geopolitical rivalries. India's "neighborhood first" policy
          underscores its commitment to strengthening ties with neighboring
          countries, prioritizing regional stability and economic cooperation.

        <h3>Regional Cooperation</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Regional cooperation initiatives, such as SAARC and the Bay of Bengal
          Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation
          (BIMSTEC), aim to enhance economic integration and collaboration among
          South Asian countries. However, progress has been hindered by
          bilateral disputes, political tensions, and divergent priorities among
          member states.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In recent years, India has pursued initiatives like the "Act East"
          policy to deepen engagement with Southeast Asian countries, leveraging
          cultural, economic, and strategic ties to enhance regional
          cooperation. Similarly, the development of infrastructure projects
          like the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway aims to bolster
          connectivity and economic integration in the region.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Overall, India's relations with neighboring countries are
          characterized by a complex interplay of historical, cultural,
          political, and economic factors. While challenges persist, there are
          ample opportunities for cooperation and collaboration, which are
          essential for fostering peace, stability, and prosperity in South Asia
          and beyond.
