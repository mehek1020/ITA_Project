        <h3>Culture</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Cultural exchanges between China and its neighbors are deeply entrenched in shared histories, ideologies, and cultural practices. Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism are three major philosophies and religions that originated in China and have significantly influenced neighboring countries such as Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Mongolia.

          <img class="cul" src="./images/history_china.webp" alt="History Image" />
          <p>
            Historically, China's relations with its neighbors have been shaped by imperial legacies, border disputes, and ideological conflicts. The legacy of the Chinese Empire, followed by periods of foreign domination and the rise of communist rule, left a complex legacy, particularly in relations between China and countries like Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. The formation of the People's Republic of China in 1949 under the Communist Party led to ideological rifts and strategic confrontations, notably during the Cold War era.

        <h3>Diplomatic Relation</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Diplomatic relations between China and its neighbors are diverse and complex, spanning areas such as trade, security, and cultural exchanges, alongside enduring territorial disputes and strategic competitions. China's "Belt and Road Initiative" illustrates its strategy to enhance regional connectivity and assert its influence in Asia, prioritizing economic partnerships and infrastructure development while navigating the geopolitical tensions that frequently arise with neighboring countries.

        <h3>Regional Cooperation</h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Regional cooperation initiatives, such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), underscore China's commitment to enhancing economic integration and collaboration among Asian countries. Nonetheless, progress is often challenged by geopolitical tensions and the diverse interests of member states.
            In recent years, China has advanced its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to strengthen ties with countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe, emphasizing infrastructure development and economic partnership. This strategy aims to facilitate better connectivity and promote regional development, as seen in projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which seeks to enhance trade routes and economic growth between China and Pakistan.

          <p>
            Overall, China's relations with neighboring countries are characterized by a complex interplay of historical, cultural, political, and economic factors. While challenges such as territorial disputes and trade imbalances persist, there are substantial opportunities for cooperation and collaboration. These relationships are crucial for fostering regional peace, stability, and prosperity across East Asia and beyond, as China continues to assert its influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and regional trade agreements.
